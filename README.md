# associatoR

Associations offer a window into the semantics of the mind, revealing how concepts and words are represented. They can be employed to map how humans and artificial intelligence think about key social and technological issues.

`associatoR` is an R package for analyzing free association data. It covers the entire analysis pipeline, from importing and processing to embedding, clustering, and visualizing the data.

## General Information

The `associatoR` package is developed by [Samuel Aeschbach](https://github.com/samuelae) and [Dirk U. Wulff](https://github.com/dwulff), with contributions from [Rui Mata](https://github.com/matarui).

## Installation

The latest development version on GitHub can be installed via `devtools::install_github("samuelae/associatoR")`. This may require prior installation of the `devtools` package via `install.packages("devtools")`.
