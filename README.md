# associatoR

Associations offer a window into the mind, revealing how words, concepts, and topics are represented. They can be used to map how humans and artificial intelligence think about key social and technological issues.

`associatoR` is an R package for analyzing free association data. It covers the entire analysis pipeline, from importing and processing to embedding, clustering, and visualizing the data.
